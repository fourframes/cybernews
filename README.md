A serverless Cloudflare Worker that fetches trending cybersecurity news relevant to companies in the DACH region via the Perplexity API, then posts curated headlines, summaries, and links directly to a Slack channel each weekday morning.

## Features

- Fetches top cybersecurity news with high-quality coverage
- Focuses on updates impacting businesses in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland
- Curates headlines, excerpts, and source links for each news item
- Automates delivery to a designated Slack channel via Incoming Webhook
- Configurable number of news entries per run
- Runs on weekdays at 9am CEST (customizable)

## How It Works

1. **Scheduled Execution:** Worker runs at 9am CEST Mondayâ€“Friday using Cloudflare cron triggers
2. **News Gathering:** Uses Perplexity API with a tailored prompt
3. **Curation:** Extracts headline, excerpt, and source URL for each news item
4. **Slack Delivery:** Posts news to Slack channel through Incoming Webhook integration

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository


### 2. Install Wrangler CLI

Follow [Wrangler installation guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/) to set up the Cloudflare Workers CLI.

### 3. Add Secrets

Set your API keys securely:

`wrangler secret put SECRET_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
`wrangler secret put SECRET_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`

Edit `wrangler.toml` to adjust:

- Cron schedule (default: `0 7 * * 1-5` for 9am CEST weekdays)

### 5. Deploy

`wrangler deploy`

## Testing

- Use `wrangler dev` to run locally
- Trigger the scheduled job with a manual endpoint (`/test-run`) for instant testing

## Slack Integration

- Enable Incoming Webhooks and add a webhook to your desired channel
- Store the webhook URL using Cloudflare secrets

## Configuration
